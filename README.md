PharBuilder - A simple phar builder script
================================================================================
This is a simple tool to help you build PHP Phar Archives.
This is not a composer package like the other components of the PhpGearBox.

How do I use it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the latest release or clone the repo.
2. Stick you source into the src folder and run the build script.

Its really not that complex.

Alternatives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's been a while since I have used this. Once upon a time phars were the next
big thing making it super easy to deploy php applications. But then along came
composer which somewhat negated that... there may possibly be better solutions
such as the following:

 - https://github.com/phine/lib-phar
 - https://github.com/clue/phar-composer

The compiler for composer it's self:
